# Large-Scale Test Management

Strategies and patterns for managing thousands of SQL tests across teams.

## Organization
- Group tests by domain (customer, orders, finance) and by frequency (smoke, daily, weekly).
- Use consistent naming and folder conventions to make ownership clear.

## Execution Planning
- Run fast smoke suites on every commit; run heavier integrity suites nightly.
- Shard large suites by subsuite across CI jobs to keep wall-clock low.

## Governance
- Require code reviews for test additions/changes.
- Track flaky tests and quarantine with a plan to fix.

## Reporting
- Publish JUnit XML to your CI test report UI.
- Export failing rows to Excel for stakeholders who prefer spreadsheets.
